# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

## I'm a student at [<span style="text-decoration: underline">Olin College</span>](https://www.olin.edu "visit Olin College "), where I'm exploring the intersection of design and engineering to create meaningful solutions and experiences.

## I like to blur the lines between the arts and tech to see the world in a new light. Through my interests in experience design, theatrical lighting, and music production, I seek to bring more of those _'woah!'_ moments into the world.

## I'm open to work, projects, and commissions! Check out [<span style="text-decoration: underline">my resume</span>](https://jasperkatzban.com/docs/Katzban-Resume-Fall-20.pdf "view resume") or take a peek at my [<span style="text-decoration: underline">design portfolio</span>](https://www.figma.com/proto/A6YgATB4szfYJo6s2Pz4Ko/Jasper's-Design-Portfolio?scaling=scale-down&node-id=9%3A19 "view portfolio").

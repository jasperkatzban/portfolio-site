# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

## I'm a student at [Olin College](https://www.olin.edu), where I'm exploring the intersection of design and software engineering to create sustainable, human-centered experiences.

<br>

## I like to blur the lines between the arts and tech to see the world in a new light. Through my interests in experience design, digital media, and software, I seek to bring more of those _'woah!'_ moments into the world.

<br>

## I'm seeking a project or internship for this summer! Check out [my resume](https://jasperkatzban.com/docs/Katzban-Resume.pdf), take a peek at my [design portfolio](https://www.figma.com/proto/A6YgATB4szfYJo6s2Pz4Ko/Jasper's-Design-Portfolio?scaling=scale-down&node-id=9%3A19), or say hi on[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasperkatzban/).

# üëãüèª Hi there!

## I like to play in the space somewhere between pixels and sound waves. Data storytelling, poetic computation, and community-focused sustainable design are the areas I find most energizing.

## I'm a graduate of [Olin College](https://www.olin.edu), where I developed community-centered [data stories](https://fairmountstories.airpartners.org/) about air quality, visualized [urban bat echolocation](https://bats.jasperkatzban.com/), and co-organized climate action events and music-making spaces.

## Currently, I live in Copenhagen, Denmark where I help promote craft and ecologically responsible material use in the interior design industry. 

## You can find me digitally on [are.na](https://www.are.na/jasper-gsujoryuxpm/) or physically on a (hopefully) green patch of Earth.

<br>

## I'm always seeking interesting collaborations! Perhaps you'd like to [say hello](mailto:jasperkatzban@gmail.com?subject=Hello!&body=Howdy%2C%0D%0A%0D%0AI%20noticed%20%5Bcool-project%5D%20on%20your%20site%20and%20wanted%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20%5Binteresting-part%5D.%20How%20is%20%5Bconvenient-time%5D%20for%20a%20chat%3F%0D%0A%0D%0ASincerely%2C%0D%0A%5Bawesome-person%5D "Contact")?

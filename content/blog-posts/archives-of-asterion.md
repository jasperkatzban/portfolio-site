An immersive WebVR experience modeled in Blender and built in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) with [Three.js](https://threejs.org) for visual effects.

As part of the [Sketch Model](https://www.olin.edu/collaborate/sketch-model/) program at Olin, I worked with award-winning creative director [Tom Pearson](https://tompearsonnyc.com) of [Third Rail Projects](https://thirdrailprojects.com) to develop and publish an immersive WebVR experience. As a continuation of the Third Rail's [Librar√≠a](https://thirdrailprojects.com/libraria) project, the experience explores an archive of dreams and mazes encoded in virtual reality.

Originally intended to be an immersive theatrical experience on campus, we transitioned the project to VR when the pandemic hit, and I had the chance to apply the findings of my prior VR UI/UX research to this story-driven project. I designed over 100 3D assets - everything from fictional environments to animated animated flying creatures - and brought them to life on the web using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org), where I scripted interactivity, gameplay sequences, and visual effects.

Working on this project helped me appreciate all the work - both creative and technical - that goes into experience design, and collaborating with an experienced artist definitely allowed me to gain creative confidence in a constructive setting. I'm excited to take what I learned and apply it to my next project!

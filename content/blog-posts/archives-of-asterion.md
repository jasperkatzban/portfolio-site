Worked with award-winning creative director [Tom Pearson](https://tompearsonnyc.com) to develop and publish an immersive WebVR experience. Modeled assets in [Blender](https://www.blender.org) and scripted interactivity/animations in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io), plus a bit of [Three.js](https://threejs.org) for visual effects. As a continuation of the [Librar√≠a](https://thirdrailprojects.com/libraria) series by Third Rail Projects, the experience explores an archive of dreams and mazes encoded in virtual reality. Supported by the [Sketch Model](https://www.olin.edu/collaborate/sketch-model/) program at Olin College.

Originally intended to be an immersive theatrical experience on campus, we transitioned the project to VR when the pandemic hit, and I had the chance to apply the findings of my prior VR UI/UX research to this story-driven project. I designed over 100 3D assets - everything from fictional environments to animated animated flying creatures - and brought them to life on the web using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org), where I scripted interactivity, gameplay sequences, and visual effects.

Working on this project helped me appreciate all the work - both creative and technical - that goes into experience design, and collaborating with an experienced artist definitely helped me gain more confidence in my creative abilities. I'm excited to take what I learned and apply it to my next project!

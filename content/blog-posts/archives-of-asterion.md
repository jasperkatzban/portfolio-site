As part of the [Sketch Model](https://www.olin.edu/collaborate/sketch-model/) program at Olin, I worked hand-in-hand with award winning creative director [Tom Pearson](https://tompearsonnyc.com) of [Third Rail Projects](https://thirdrailprojects.com) to develop and publish an immersive WebVR experience. As a continuation of the Third Rail's [Librar√≠a](https://thirdrailprojects.com/libraria) project, the experience explores an archive of dreams and mazes encoded in virtual reality.

Originally intended to be an immersive theatrical experience on campus, we transitioned the project to VR when the pandemic hit, and I had the chance to apply the findings of my prior VR UI/UX research to this story-driven project.

I designed over 100 3D assets - everything from fictional environments to animated animated flying creatures - and brought them to life on the web using [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) and [Three.js](https://threejs.org), where I scripted interactivity, gameplay sequences, and visual effects.

I'm thankful to have had the opportunity to work on an interactive experience of this nature. It helped me realize all the work - only some of which is technical - that goes into experience design, and working with an experienced creative director allowed me to grow my creative confidence in a constructive setting.

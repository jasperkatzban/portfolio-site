When we found out we'd be leaving Olin's campus due to the pandemic, the common spaces in our dorms were suddenly flooded with extra clothing,  course textbooks, and all sorts of gadgets and parts. With short notice of our departure, many of us couldn't take home all our belongings, and were forced to donate extra items to the community. 

As students in the Software Design course at Olin, we wanted to learn by solving a tangible problem in our lives. We thought: what would it take to create a Craigslist style market for the good and items exchanged between students on campus?

what we did

I learned a lot about front-end development and how to work with a remote team to implement a web app from scratch. Using Firebase Storage, a Flask / Python backend, and some Bootstrap styling, we worked together to bring our creation to life over the course of a few weeks of zoom-school.

Each new formatting or styling technique I learned was like a whole new world of possibilities to me, and I'd excitedly report back to my team with UI updates as the course drew to a close.

During my first semester at Olin College, I took a course called Design Nature, which integrates principles in bio-inspired design with sustainable prototyping. Students get a hands-on introduction to mechanical design and rapid prototyping, looking to the results of millions of years of evolution for design cues.

For our first project, we used recycled materials to design a 'hopper' contraption inspired by organisms in nature that jump — frogs, kangaroos, and insects like the click beetle.

In typical Olin fashion, students are able to direct their learning, and after some initial research and sketches, I settled on the following goal:

**Design an autonomous bio-inspired hopper that jumps 1 meter without rotating more than 90º off axis.**

# Initial Sketches

In order to make something that hops, it was crucial to understand the natural ways organisms have evolved to store and release energy. This research began with some observation and ideation

From there, I sketched out different concept designs, inspired by a range of different jumping critters I observed.

# Prototyping

After some low fidelity sketch modeling, I settled on the frog legs concept and began to iterate further. The design is essentially a leaf spring, utilizing a set of horizontal springs for propulsion. In its armed state, the springs are outstretched and the hopper force opposing pivot points together and elongating the hopper.

Initial prototypes consisted of roughly cut Eucaboard (composite board made of Eucalyptus), while later designs were modeled in Fusion3D and laser cut to assemble precisely.

With the first model, I tested the general mechanics of the design, how the materials interacted with each other, and the spring force required to make the apparatus jump (and not self-destruct). From testing, I learned that I'd need to beef up the joints on the eucaboard quite a bit, and that the springs exerted way too much force on the frame. I also realized the rough edge finish from cutting and filing the eucaboard resulted in wobbly and unreliable motion - something I'd need to fix to ensure my hopper jumped straight up.

In CAD, I revised the design to transfer force more evenly through the structure and fine tuned the tolerances of the through holes to lower friction but maintain structural stability.

A crucial part of the hopper's ability to jump lies in its trigger mechanism - the component that allows it to stay in an 'armed' state for at least three seconds before jumping without any human contact, a requirement of the project. I used

# A Leap of Knowledge

The hopper jumped over one meter into the air and rotated less than 90º, satisfying my design goal.

It was a lot of fun to prototype

# Bio-inspired Design

Good design often comes from nature. Why redesign something which has been naturally perfected over thousands of years? By studying the natural ways animals have adapted to survive - say, hopping away to avoid being a predator's lunch - we can succeed at tasks that have already been perfected in nature over millions of years

As part of the Design Nature course at Olin, I worked on a project incorporating the natural mechanisms found in hoppers - insects and other critters that make use of stored energy to jump astronomical distances compared to their size. Incorporate energy storage methods and propulsion techniques found in the click beetle and frog, to design a hopper which can jump at least 4 feet vertically, and rotate about its center of gravity.

I seek to learn why various aspects of biomimicry are difficult and how to adapt my design thinking to account for the areas where nature doesn’t transfer well into engineering, as well as learning some basic mechanical engineering skills necessary to make my hopper function.

I’m guessing, however, that some parts of nature don’t translate into the engineering world very well, thus I believe that an awareness of these more challenging aspects would be beneficial not only in the hopper project, but throughout my design work (especially in the physical sense).

# Prototyping

I’ve done rudimentary work within CAD software and feel comfortable working on a manual mill and lathe, but lack the experience prototyping with materials such as those used in this project. I also want to learn how to account for the properties and limitations of these materials throughout the design process, as well as how to prototype sustainably (I’m super excited that this is an important part of DN!).

Aesthetic

Built to mimic the leg motion of a frog by jumping in a controlled matter without rotating significantly in flight.

<div style="align: center"><p>

The wire at top creates a tight but flexible fit with the rubber tubing at bottom, creating a friction trigger which slowly allows both parts to separate and launch the hopper.</p>

STORED ENERGY

Akin to a leaf spring, energy stored in the springs horizon-tally is converted to vertical tension which, when released, rapidly shifts the center of mass upwards and causes the hopper to jump.

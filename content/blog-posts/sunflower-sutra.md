Using the mozzi sound synthesis library for arduinos, I designed and built a simple digital analog modeling synthesizer complete with 4 waveforms, a filter, vibrato, an envelope, and an LFO. Housed inside a cheap wooden box from the crafts store, this quirky little sound box comes in at a fraction of the cost of commercial synthesizers, but sacrifices much the sonic fidelity and reliability found in the state-of-the-art products out there.

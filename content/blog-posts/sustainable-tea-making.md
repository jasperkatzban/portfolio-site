Case study on the environmental and human health impacts of tea-making, culminating in a proposal for safer municipal water infrastructure proposal.

In addition to running material analysis and performing a life cycle assessment with my team, I led the graphic design and info visualization aspects of this case study. Below are the posters we produced, which outline the tea-making experience, its impact, and a proposed system which uses tea as a lens to look at and improve the safety of public water infrastructure.

+++
A web-based 3D visualizer of asteroid positions using the \[Minor Planet Center\]([https://www.minorplanetcenter.net](https://www.minorplanetcenter.net "https://www.minorplanetcenter.net"))'s data. Built in threeJS with a python sqlite database to serve asteroid data. Created in collaboration with [Eamon Ito-Fisher](https://github.com/eito-fis).

Current features include: 

* Visualization of hundreds of thousands of asteroidsâ€™ positions
* Visualization of asteroids based on the survey they were discovered in
* Highlighting of individual asteroids to show survey metadata

This is still a work in progress, but I plan to host a demo somewhere soon. Stay tuned for more details, and in the meantime check out the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/olincollege/scicomp-p3-collisions-in-space)!

An interactive exhibition exploring the links between material science and the sounds of metals in musical instruments. Used Blender and Adobe Illustrator to work across 2D / 3D media.

> # Concept

Metal has been used in instruments for hundreds if not thousands of years – but what makes a xylophone sound different than church bells? With modern  materials analysis tools and a bit of materials science knowledge, it turns out that we can learn a lot about how metals sound!

Working with a team of material science students, I helped design an interactive exhibition inspired by [micro.ooo](https://micro.ooo)'s 'micro museum' concepts.

# Interaction

Museums should be fun. With a hammer, viewers could hear the effects of heat treating on steel, helping connect the dots to the science behind our experiments.
